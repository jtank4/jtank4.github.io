		To use this, click the share button on a youtube video and check the button to start at a certain time. Copy everthing including and after the question mark onto the end of the url https://jtank4.github.io/clipYoutubeVid.html
		and remove the s after the number of seconds in the t parameter.
		Then you can add &e=the number of seconds at which the video should stop
		to the end of the url. You can look at the current url as an example of how it should look at the end.
